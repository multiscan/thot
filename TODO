Bugs:
 ☐ does admin_signed_in? work ?
 ☐ inactivity monitor: seems like the time is not restarted after reset
Inventory:
 ✔ when checking inventory return books that are checked out @done (13-07-01 12:55)
 ✔ show previous shelf and status in goods listing @done (13-07-01 12:55)
 ✔ goods listing in printable format for manual inventory checking @done (13-06-28 16:00)
 ☐ can owner in inventory session form be removed ?
 ☐ sort missing items by call numbers

Sorting:
 ☐ when showing a search, include sorting options if more than one page of results
 ☐ add sorting options on possibly all pages listing items

 Testing:

Legacy:
 ✔ move legacy import away from db:seed @done (13-06-28 11:00)
 ✔ seed borrow date and item creation date @done (13-06-28 10:55)

Rails 4:
 ☐ better strong params (see http://railscasts.com/episodes/371-strong-parameters)

Optimization:
 ☐ reduce SELECT COUNT on listings (e.g. adm/locations, adm/users)

Security:
 ☐ add authorize! anywhere it is needed
