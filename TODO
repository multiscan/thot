 ☐ ping user about borrowed book (email sent anonymously by thot server)
 ☐ do something with book subtitle (e.g. allow editing and display at least in show)

Rails 4:
 ☐ better strong params (see http://railscasts.com/episodes/371-strong-parameters)

Optimization:
 ☐ reduce SELECT COUNT on listings (e.g. adm/locations, adm/users)
 ☐ add db indexes where needed!
 ☐ do we need form models for simpler code ?

Security:
 ☐ add authorize! anywhere it is needed
